# ServoControl
## Remote control using Python, Arduino, OSC and TouchOSC App with Smartphone (iPhone iOS or Android)

I am not an experience Python programmer, so I wrote a mickymous program to control a servo with my iPhone.
There are for sure much clever way's to do this, so all feedback and improvements are very welcome.

 
For instance I use an UDP server to get the path from the touchOSC app and then I start a OSC server to contol it. There must be a smarter way to do this.

I wrote a extensive readme (this one) so that dummies like me get it working. If things are not clear, please contact me.

**so here we go:**

##Prerequisites:

* **Python editor:** I prefer PCharm: ` <http://macdown.uranusjr.com>`
